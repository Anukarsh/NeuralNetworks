## Synopsis
The is our first venture in the field of Neural Networks. We started with coding basic gates involving back propogation. We then explored the application of neural networks in Face recognition.

## Motivation
A neural network learning algorithm called Backpropagation is among the most effective approaches to machine learning when the data includes complex sensory input such as images. This web page provides an implementation of the Backpropagation algorithm described in Chapter 4 of the textbook [Machine Learning](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/mitchell/ftp/mlbook.html).
## Installation
You can get all the code to your system by following the below instructions.  

Run this in your terminal  
```
git clone https://github.com/anukarsh/NeuralNetwork
```
or  
  
Download as a zip from the link provided.



## Tests
All codes are in .c format and can be executed as follows.  

Compile the C file
```
gcc <filename.c>
```
Execute it
```
./a.out
```
####Face recognition  
The test cases taken here are image files of faces in .pgm format. The data set is obtained from [Tom Mitchell's](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/) [site](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/mitchell/ftp/faces.html)
